We continue our discussion of the role of climate in various biological and ecological processes including species distributions, phenology, and ecosystem services. We will also discuss how these processes may change in a changing climate and how we measure them. We discuss issues of scale, resolution, and time period in analysis. We will also cover how to summarize 'ecologically relevant' metrics of climate (such as the length of the growing season in temperate areas or drought severity). Participants will work on developing climate summaries for New England and prepare them for analysis.
